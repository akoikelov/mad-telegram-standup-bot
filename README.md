Add @SimpleStandupBot to your telegram channel to start using it right away.

## Bot Skills

- Warns about upcomming standup deadline in case intern did not write standup yet
- Members join and leave standup teams on their own (no time from managers needed)
- Can adjust to different timezones 
- Detects standups by watching messages with bot tag and defined keywords
- supports English and Runssian languages. To add more, see https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n for language reference

## Local usage
First you need to set env variables:
```
export TELEGRAM_TOKEN=yourTelegramTokenRecievedFromBotFather
export DEBUG=true
```
Install [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep)

Then run. Note, you need `Docker` and `docker-compose` installed on your system

```
make run
```
To run tests: 
```
make clear
make test
```
To debug locally without docker use:
```
make clear
make setup
go run main.go
```
This should setup a database and run all the migrations for you. 

To update messages: 
First install CLI from [original repo](https://github.com/nicksnyder/go-i18n) then follow these steps:

1. Make changes to your default messages
2. Run `goi18n extract` to update English translation files
3. Create translate.ru.toml file for Russian translations
3. Run `goi18n merge active.*.toml translate.*.toml` to change translated messages to update Russian translations
4. Run `goi18n merge active.*.toml` to update russian translations

## Install on your server 

1. Build and push bot's image to Dockerhub or any other container registry: 
```
docker build  -t <youraccount>/mad-telegram-standup-bot  .
```
```
docker push <youraccount>/mad-telegram-standup-bot
```
2. Enter server, install `docker` and `docker-compose` there. Create `docker-compose.yaml` file by the example from this repo
3. Create `.env` file with variables needed to run bot:
```
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=603860531:AAEB95f4tq18RWZtKLFJDFLKFDFfdsfds
DEBUG=false
```
4. Pull image from registry and run it in the backgroud with
